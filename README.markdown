# Hello-World - Common Lisp Hello World project.
This is a simple Common Lisp project that I built for testing and demonstrating different software technologies including unit testing, devops CI/CD, etc.

The project contains a system **hello-world** and another system **hello-world/tests** with runs the test for the system. Currently the application doesn't do much and it is intentionally kept that way. The focus is not on the system but how the required building blocks to achieve unit testing, devops, etc, can be achieved.
